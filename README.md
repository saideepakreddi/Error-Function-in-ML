# Error-Function-in-ML
Code which plots error function with parametric values in python(Machine Learning)
The code with file name errorfunction.ipynb, plots the error function with respect to one parametric value that is slope of line. y=wx, plots errorfunction vs w.
The code with file name errorfunc3D.ipynb, plots the error function with respect to two parametric values whice is slope and intercept for line y=wx+w1, plots errorfunction vs w,w1 in 3D space.
The code with file name errorfuncnoise.ipynb, plots the error function with respect to two parametric values which is slope and intercept and added noise to the original data sets for line y=wx+w1+noise, plots errorfunction vs w,w1 in 3D space.
